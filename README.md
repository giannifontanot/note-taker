# Note Taker
This project allows the user to take notes using the browser and save them in a JSON file. The notes can be viewed in a later time because the JSON file is located on a Heroku space. The front end was already in place, and we as developers created the backend using NodeJS and ExpressJS.

## Installation
To install the source code in Heroku we will need only the NodeJS and ExpressJS packages. The data is saved using a JSON file, then there is no need of a database. The application is running in just one file of Javascript in the server and if you want to see the actual code it is very easy to follow.
## Usage
This piece of software, although is small, it can be very handy to save quick notes in the browser. If you save the address using a bookmark then you will have a very nice and useful notepad.
